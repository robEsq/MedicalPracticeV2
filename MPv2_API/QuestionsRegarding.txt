1)
Is using [JsonIgnore] on the fields that have relationships with other models good practice?
	In this context it is so that PUT and POST can be done.

2)
How would I make API calls to join tables together?
	Do I need to map out my own joining tables? Because they weren't created in during EF scaffolding.

3) 
Is it okay to use LINQ for HTTP requests?
